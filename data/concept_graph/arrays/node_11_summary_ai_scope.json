    "core_idea": "This node consolidates all array concepts and defines the safe boundaries for AI interactions.",
    "explanation": [
      "Arrays are contiguous blocks of fixed-size elements allowing predictable memory access.",
      "Indexing allows direct computation of element addresses.",
      "Random access and cache locality explain practical speed.",
      "Traversal, insertion, deletion, and multi-dimensional access follow from these fundamentals.",
      "Think-LIE can safely teach concepts within this scope and avoid topics like dynamic resizing or advanced optimizations."
    ],
    "key_points": [
      "Memory representation, contiguity, and indexing form the foundation",
      "Random access and cache explain performance intuition",
      "Traversal and operations extend naturally",
      "Multi-dimensional arrays follow same principles",
      "AI-scope defines what is safe to explain"
    ]
  },
  "examples": [
    "arr[5] is accessed directly using base_address + 5 * element_size",
    "2D array arr[1][2] uses formula base + (1*row_size + 2) * size"
  ],
  "common_misconceptions": [
    "Arrays are always faster than other data structures in every scenario",
    "Memory layout is invisible to performance"
