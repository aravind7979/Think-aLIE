    "core_idea": "All data in a computer is ultimately represented as binary bits grouped into bytes.",
    "explanation": [
      "A bit is the smallest unit of data and can be either 0 or 1.",
      "Eight bits form one byte.",
      "Data types like integers are represented using a fixed number of bytes.",
      "The meaning of data depends on how those bytes are interpreted."
    ],
    "key_points": [
      "Bits are the fundamental units of data",
      "Bytes are groups of 8 bits",
      "Data types have fixed sizes in memory",
      "Memory stores raw bits, not meanings"
    ]
  },
  "examples": [
    "An integer may occupy 4 bytes (32 bits) in memory.",
    "The same sequence of bits can represent different values depending on interpretation."
  ],
  "common_misconceptions": [
    "Memory understands integers or characters",
    "All data types take the same amount of memory"
