    "core_idea": "Arrays allow direct access to any element using its index without iterating over previous elements.",
    "explanation": [
      "Because elements are contiguous and have fixed size, the memory address can be calculated instantly.",
      "Accessing arr[i] requires only base_address + (i × element_size).",
      "No scanning or traversal is needed."
    ],
    "key_points": [
      "Direct address computation",
      "No loops needed for access",
      "All elements are reachable instantly"
    ]
  },
  "examples": [
    "arr[5] can be accessed directly from memory using its offset.",
    "In contrast, linked lists require traversal to reach the 5th element."
  ],
  "common_misconceptions": [
    "Accessing a later element requires scanning all previous elements",
    "Random access means data is shuffled in memory"
