    "core_idea": "An array stores elements in consecutive memory locations without gaps.",
    "explanation": [
      "When an array is created, a continuous block of memory is allocated.",
      "Each element occupies the same fixed number of bytes.",
      "Elements are placed one after another in memory.",
      "The first element has a base address, and all others are located at fixed offsets from it."
    ],
    "key_points": [
      "Memory is allocated as one continuous block",
      "All elements have uniform size",
      "There are no gaps between elements",
      "The array has a single base address"
    ]
  },
  "examples": [
    "An array of 5 integers occupies 5 × 4 = 20 consecutive bytes.",
    "If the base address is 1000, the next element starts at 1004."

  "common_misconceptions": [
    "Array elements are scattered in memory",
    "Each element has its own independent memory block"
