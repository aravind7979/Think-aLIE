    "core_idea": "Array indexing works by computing the memory address of an element using a base address and a fixed offset.",
    "explanation": [
      "An array has a base address, which is the address of its first element.",
      "Each element has the same fixed size in bytes.",
      "To access the element at index i, the system calculates an offset based on element size.",
      "The address is computed as: base_address + (index × element_size)."
    ],
    "key_points": [
      "Indexing is address calculation",
      "Element size is constant",
      "Offsets are predictable",
      "No searching is involved"
    ]
  },
  "examples": [
    "If base address is 1000 and element size is 4 bytes, arr[3] is at 1012.",
    "Index 0 always refers to the base address."
  ],
  "common_misconceptions": [
    "Indexing involves searching for the element",
    "Index numbers are stored with elements"
