    "core_idea": "Memory is a large sequence of addressable storage locations where data is stored as bytes.",
    "explanation": [
      "A computer's memory can be imagined as a long row of boxes.",
      "Each box has a unique address.",
      "Each address stores a byte of data.",
      "All higher-level data structures are built on top of this memory model."
    ],
    "key_points": [
      "Memory is byte-addressable",
      "Each memory location has an address",
      "Data structures do not exist without memory"
    ]
  },
  "examples": [
    "An integer occupies multiple consecutive bytes in memory.",
    "A variable name is just a label pointing to a memory address."

  "common_misconceptions": [
    "Memory automatically understands data types",
    "Variables store values directly instead of addresses"
